#### Remarks
Issuance of tokens depends on the role at the discord STAKEME channel. The more important your role is on the server, the more tokens you will receive from FAUCETME.

If you want to get more tokens, you can get special roles in the STAKEME discord team. Just do a few simple tasks, subscribe to the Shardium project's social networks and you will get more tokens.

Also, a higher priority roles gives you the right to use automatic token issuance in our faucet.
