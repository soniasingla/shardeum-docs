## Actions Completed

As per item 12.f in the license document, we have created this page on the Shardeum network website that contains:

1.  The link to the block explorer transaction notarizing the hash of the license file using a public key belonging to the Shardeum Foundation.

2.  A statement of the percentage of the maximum supply of Shardeum network coins allocated to be claimed by Shardus token (ULT) holders. We have chosen to allocate 1% (the minimum required) of the 508 million maximum supply of coins on the Shardeum network.


As per item 12.e in the license document, we have used an address belonging to the Shardeum Foundation to notarize the hash of the above document. This can be verified on the Ethereum network:
